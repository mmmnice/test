Deliverable 4.3: Deployment Report

To deploy this project, I used Netlify.  With this website, any user who would like to deploy their own code needs to connect their github account to the site and choose the repository they would like to deploy.  It is as simple as that.  The only issue that was present was that the html document that is needed to view the project was under the name of “quiz.html.”  The error was that the site could not be found in the random link that was provided to view the deployed website.  For Netlify, the name must be “index.html” for Netlify to recognize it as a readable html template.  To add more functionality to the website for future updates, new commits simply have to be pushed to the github repository.  The Netlify link should work normally and use the updated repository code automatically, so the scalability of using this website is relatively simple with using Netlify to deploy it.
